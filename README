CompEconR
=====================

The aim of this project is to port Miranda &  Fackler's CompEcon toolbox from Matlab to R.

This is still work in progress. To date, most of quadrature routines have been ported. Interpolation routines (Chebyshev and spline basis) are partially implemented, but they will differ from the original CompEcon version (they will be object oriented, similar to what is available in my "Interpolation" repository).
